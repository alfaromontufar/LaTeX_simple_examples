LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system, used
for producing scientific and mathematical
documents of high typographic quality. Unlike
WYSIWYG tools such as FrameMaker and Word,
it uses plain text files that contain formatting
commands. It’s big, open source, stable and used
by many technical publishing companies. It’s
also relatively unknown in the technical writing
community. This article overviews LaTeX, and
directs you to sources of information.
